                <h2>Sunfish</h2>
                <p>
                    Sunfish, also known as mola, are large, flat-bodied ocean fish that can weigh over 2,000 pounds. They are known for their unique shape, with a tall, flattened body and long dorsal and anal fins. Sunfish mostly eat jellyfish, but they also feed on small fish, plankton, and algae. Despite their size, they are gentle and often seen basking near the surface of the ocean. Sunfish are found in warm and temperate oceans around the world.

                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>
                    Sunfish, also known as mola, inhabit warm and temperate oceans around the world. They are commonly found near the surface of the ocean but can also dive to deeper waters in search of food. Sunfish prefer open waters rather than coastal or reef environments. They are often seen basking in the sun near the surface, which is how they got their name. These fish can be found in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including areas off the coasts of Europe, North America, and Asia.

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    Sunfish, also known as mola, have a varied diet that mainly consists of jellyfish, which make up a large part of their food intake. They also eat small fish, squid, crustaceans, and zooplankton. Despite their large size, sunfish prefer soft-bodied prey that is easy to swallow. They feed near the surface as well as in deeper waters, depending on where their prey is found. Their diet helps control jellyfish populations and supports balance in the marine ecosystem.

                <h3>Social Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    Sunfish, also known as mola, are generally solitary creatures but may occasionally be seen in pairs or small groups. They are not highly social and do not form structured schools like many other fish. Sunfish often interact with other marine animals, such as cleaner fish or seabirds, to help remove parasites from their skin. They sometimes bask near the surface of the water, which may attract the attention of other sunfish or marine life. Despite their size, they are peaceful and slow-moving, with minimal aggressive behavior toward others.
