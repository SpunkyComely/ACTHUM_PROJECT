            <h2>Peacock</h2>
            <div id="peacock-details">
            <p>
                The peacock, known for its stunningly vibrant plumage, is the male of the peafowl species, with the female being called a peahen. 
                Its most famous feature is the large, iridescent tail feathers that fan out in a striking display during courtship rituals. 
                These feathers are adorned with eye-like patterns, which the peacock uses to attract mates. 
                Peafowls are omnivores, feeding on a variety of plants, insects, and small animals in their native habitats.
                While peacocks are native to South Asia, they have been introduced to other regions, including parts of Africa and Europe.

            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>
                Peacocks are native to the Indian subcontinent, primarily found in India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. 
                They thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and agricultural areas. 
                Typically, they prefer open woodlands with a mix of dense vegetation and open spaces for foraging. 
                Peafowls are often found near water sources such as rivers, ponds, and lakes, as they require access to water for drinking and bathing.
                They build their nests on the ground, usually in tall grass or shrubs, where they are sheltered from predators. 
                During the breeding season, male peacocks perform elaborate displays in open areas to attract mates.

            alt="Diet" onclick="enlargeImage(this)"> 
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
                Peacocks are omnivorous, meaning their diet consists of both plant-based and animal-based foods. 
                They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, berries, and leaves, foraging on the ground in their natural habitats. 
                In addition to vegetation, peafowls also consume small insects, insects larvae, and even small reptiles, which provide them with essential proteins. 
                Peafowls are known to eat agricultural crops, occasionally becoming pests in fields of rice, grains, or vegetables.
                Their diet varies depending on the season, as they adapt to the availability of different food sources. 
                Peacocks have strong beaks that help them pick through the ground to find food, and they are skilled at scratching the earth to uncover hidden items. 
                While they typically forage during the day, peafowls often drink water from nearby streams, ponds, or other fresh water sources to stay hydrated.</p>

            alt="Social Behavior" onclick="enlargeImage(this)">
            <h3>Social Behavior</h3>
            <p>
                Peacocks are generally social birds, often found in small groups called parties, especially outside of the breeding season. 
                Males tend to form loose groups while the females usually stay in smaller family units. 
                During mating season, the peacock's social behavior becomes more focused on courtship displays, 
                where males perform their extravagant tail-fanning rituals to attract peahens.
                These displays are a key part of their social interactions, with the male often calling loudly to signal his presence. 
                Peafowls are also known to have a strict social hierarchy, where dominant males usually get the most attention from females.
