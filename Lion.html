      <h2>Lion</h2>
      <p>
        Lions, scientifically known as Panthera leo, are large, powerful cats primarily found in Africa and parts of India.
        They are unique among cats for their social structure, living in groups called prides, which consist of related females, their cubs,
        and a few adult males. Male lions are easily recognized by their prominent manes, which vary in color and size.
        As apex predators, lions primarily hunt large ungulates like zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo.
        They are primarily nocturnal, with females typically doing the hunting while males defend the territory.
        Lion populations have been declining due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, leading to their classification as a vulnerable species.

      <h3>Habitat</h3>
      <p>
        Lions primarily inhabit savannas and grasslands, open landscapes that provide ample prey and cover.
        These majestic cats are also adaptable, extending their range into dry woodlands and scrublands.
        While they thrive in these diverse environments, they are notably absent from dense forests and rainforests.
        Their habitat selection is strongly influenced by the availability of prey.
        The presence of water sources is also crucial, particularly during dry seasons.
        Lions often establish their territories around these vital resources.

      <h3>Diet</h3>
      <p>
        Lions are obligate carnivores, meaning their diet consists solely of meat.
        Primarily, they hunt large ungulates like zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo.
        They are opportunistic hunters, also preying on smaller animals when available.
        Lions will scavenge carcasses found in their territory, supplementing their hunting efforts.
        A single adult male lion can consume up to 40kg (88 lbs) of meat in one sitting.
        On average, a female lion requires about 5kg (11 lbs) of meat per day.

      <h3>Social Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Lions are highly social animals, living in groups called prides.
        These prides typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males.
        Female lions form the core of the pride, engaging in cooperative hunting and raising cubs together.
        Male lions primarily defend the pride's territory.
        Social grooming is common, strengthening bonds.
        Communication involves a range of vocalizations, including roars, grunts, and meows.
