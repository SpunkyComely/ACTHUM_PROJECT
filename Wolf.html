                        Wolves, scientifically known as Canis lupus, are highly social mammals that live in packs with complex hierarchies. 
                        These apex predators play a crucial role in regulating ecosystems by controlling prey populations. 
                        Their diet primarily consists of large ungulates like deer, elk, and moose. Wolves communicate through a variety of vocalizations, 
                        including howls, barks, and growls, which serve to maintain pack cohesion and territory. 
                        Once nearly extinct in many regions due to human persecution, conservation efforts have led to their successful reintroduction. 
                        They are known for their strong family bonds and cooperative hunting strategies, thriving in diverse habitats from forests and mountains to tundra and grasslands.

                    <p>
                        Wolves are highly adaptable and inhabit a wide range of environments, from the Arctic tundra to forests, mountains, and grasslands. 
                        Their primary habitat requirement is sufficient prey and suitable denning sites. Wolves prefer areas with minimal human disturbance, 
                        allowing for successful hunting and breeding. In forested regions, they utilize dense undergrowth for cover and hunting.
                        In mountainous areas, they follow elevation changes to track prey. On tundra, wolves adapt to harsh conditions, hunting caribou and muskoxen. 
                        In grasslands, they target bison and other large herbivores.

                    <p>
                        Wolves are primarily carnivores. Their main prey includes large ungulates like deer, elk, moose, and caribou. 
                        Smaller mammals such as rabbits, rodents, and beavers also supplement their diet. Wolves are opportunistic feeders, 
                        occasionally consuming birds, fish, or even insects. When large prey is scarce, they may scavenge carrion.
                        Wolves can eat up to 20 pounds of food at once after a successful hunt, allowing them to endure long gaps between meals.

                        Wolves are highly social animals, living in structured packs typically led by a dominant breeding pair. 
                        Pack cohesion is maintained through complex communication, including howls and body language. 
                        Within the pack, wolves cooperate in hunting, raising pups, and defending their territory. 
                        Pups are nurtured by all pack members, reinforcing social bonds. 
                        Social hierarchy is maintained through displays of dominance and submission, minimizing conflict. 
                        Wolves often stay with their birth pack for extended periods, strengthening familial ties and cooperative survival.
