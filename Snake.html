            <div id="snake-details">
            <p>
                Snakes are elongated, legless reptiles known for their unique ability to slither on the ground. 
                They belong to the suborder Serpentes and are found in a wide range of environments across the world, from deserts to tropical forests. 
                Snakes have specialized scales that help them move smoothly across various surfaces, and they rely on their flexible jaws to swallow prey whole. 
                While many species are non-venomous, some, like cobras and vipers, possess venom that they use to immobilize or kill prey.
                They are carnivorous animals, feeding primarily on small animals such as rodents, birds, and amphibians. 
                Snakes are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is regulated by the surrounding environment, and they rely on basking in the sun to warm up.

            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>
                Snakes are highly adaptable and can be found in a wide variety of habitats, from forests and grasslands to deserts and wetlands. 
                They are also known to inhabit rocky areas, caves, and even urban environments, where they seek shelter in abandoned buildings or under debris. 
                Different species have specific habitat preferences, with some thriving in the treetops, while others are ground dwellers.
                Many snakes prefer environments with a steady source of food, such as rodent populations, and access to water is also important for their survival. 
                Some species, like sea snakes, are adapted to marine environments and can be found in warm coastal waters. 
                Snakes often seek out hidden spaces, like burrows or crevices, to avoid extreme temperatures and predators.

            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
                Snakes are carnivorous, with a diet that primarily consists of small animals, including rodents, birds, amphibians, and even other reptiles. 
                They are known for their ability to swallow prey whole, often consuming animals much larger than their head, thanks to their flexible jaws. 
                Most snakes are ambush predators, waiting patiently for prey to come within striking distance, before quickly capturing and constricting it or delivering venom. 
                Some species, like constrictors, subdue their prey by wrapping around it and squeezing until it suffocates, 
                while venomous snakes use their toxins to immobilize and digest their meals.

            alt="Social Behavior" onclick="enlargeImage(this)">
            <h3>Social Behavior</h3>
            <p>
                Snakes are generally solitary creatures, and most species prefer to live and hunt alone, especially when it comes to adult snakes. They are territorial animals, with many species defending specific areas, particularly during the breeding season. While snakes do not engage in complex social behaviors like some mammals, they may gather in groups during hibernation in colder climates, known as hibernacula. Some species, like pythons and boas, can exhibit social behaviors when it comes to mating, with males competing for the attention of a female. 
                During these mating periods, multiple males may be seen interacting with each other and the female in a non-aggressive manner. </p>
